MIPS Encoding Reference
Instruction Encodings

Each MIPS instruction is encoded in exactly one word (32 bits). There are three encoding formats.

Register Encoding

This encoding is used for instructions which do not require any immediate data. These instructions receive all their operands in registers. Additionally, certain of the bit shift instructions use this encoding; their operands are two registers and a 5-bit shift amount.

Field	Width	Description
o	6	Instruction opcode. This is 000000 for instructions using this encoding.
s	5	First source register, in the range 0-31.
t	5	Second source register, in the range 0-31.
d	5	Destination register, in the range 0-31.
a	5	Shift amount, for shift instructions.
f	6	Function. Determines which operation is to be performed. Values for this field are documented in the tables at the bottom of this page.
Immediate Encoding

This encoding is used for instructions which require a 16-bit immediate operand. These instructions typically receive one operand in a register, another as an immediate value coded into the instruction itself, and place their results in a register. This encoding is also used for load, store, branch, and other instructions so the use of the fields is different in some cases.

Note that the "first" and "second" registers are not always in this order in the assembly language; see "Instruction Syntax" for details.

Field	Width	Description
o	6	Instruction opcode. Determines which operation is to be performed. Values for this field are documented in the tables at the bottom of this page.
s	5	First register, in the range 0-31.
t	5	Second register, in the range 0-31.
i	16	Immediate data. These 16 bits of immediate data are interpreted differently for different instructions. 2's-complement encoding is used to represent a number between -215 and 215-1.
Jump Encoding

This encoding is used for jump instructions, which require a 26-bit immediate offset. It is also used for the trap instruction.

i	26	Immediate data. These 26 bits of immediate data are interpreted differently for different instructions. 2's-complement encoding is used to represent a number between -225 and 225-1.
Instruction Syntax

This is a table of all the different types of instruction as they appear in the assembly listing. Note that each syntax is associated with exactly one encoding which is used to encode all instructions which use that syntax.

DivMult	f $s, $t
Shift	f $d, $t, a
ShiftV	f $d, $t, $s

MoveTo	f $s
Immediate	ArithLogI	o $t, $s, i
LoadI	o $t, immed32	i is high or low 16 bits of immed32
Branch	o $s, $t, label	i is calculated as (label - (current + 4)) >> 2
BranchZ	o $s, label	i is calculated as (label - (current + 4)) >> 2
LoadStore	o $t, i ($s)

Opcode Table

These tables list all of the available operations in MIPS. For each instruction, the 6-bit opcode or function is shown. The syntax column indicates which syntax is used to write the instruction in assembly text files. Note that which syntax is used for an instruction also determines which encoding is to be used. Finally the operation column describes what the operation does in pseudo-Java plus some special notation as follows:

"MEM [a]:n" means the n bytes of memory starting with address a.
The address must always be aligned; that is, a must be divisible by n, which must be a power of 2.

"LB (x)" means the least significant 8 bits of the 32-bit location x.
"LH (x)" means the least significant 16 bits of the 32-bit location x.
"HH (x)" means the most significant 16 bits of the 32-bit location x.

"SE (x)" means the 32-bit quantity obtained by extending the value x on the left with its most significant bit.
"ZE (x)" means the 32-bit quantity obtained by extending the value x on the left with 0 bits.
